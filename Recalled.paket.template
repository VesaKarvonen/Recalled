description
        Recalled is a library for defining persistent, incremental, parallel
        computations such as build systems.  The two goals for Recalled are to
        make it straightforward to define such computations and to effectively
        scale such computations by utililizing all CPU cores and by sharing
        results among a network of workstations.
releaseNotes
        This is an experimental version of Recalled and is not recommended for
        production use.
